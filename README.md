## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

I use the webpage W3School for some more CSS properties: https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp
I used the webpage from mozilla to better understand the functions in Javascript: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

My main challenge was understading throughoutly how the app would work as I follow the steps. Each step was pretty manageble, yet understading as a whole is 
very complicated. Thus, everytime I implemented a new feature inside my app, I would go back to see how it is interacting with my other components. I think 
it is very important to make sure eveything is working properly and your understanding of the system is clear before moving on to other features. Also, it is very easy for me to overfill myself with details I want to add to my app. There are lots of things I think of at one moment that it seems 
really overwhelmed.Yet, after an hour of overthinking, I decide to take a step back and work on one thing at a time. This turns out to be extremely 
helpful since it allows me to make one component perfect and then move on to the next one. Finally, the technical part is truly an obstacle for me. Although I have had a chance to work with Python and Java, implemeting the same concepts into 
the new language without bugs is certainly hard. However, I know the importance of reading the documentation throughoutly so I think it is manageble 
after some time struggling.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I know there is much more beyond just plain Javascript + HTML/CSS for web development so I am really exciting to learn them. I would love to dive in the front
end libraries/frameworks as well as the backend of the web. Also, I want to understand how to make my own website at the end of the internship. Besides,
I understand that a good developer can make his web run efficiently (not consuming too much resources on the computer) and securely from attacks.
There are many things I like to know and I will try my best to learn in the internship.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would make the sounds better, maybe learning how to make my custom sound.
I would improve the effect of the buttons since I saw many beatiful effects on the Internet.
I would make it a bit more complicated, like including a high score board, login screen, etc...
